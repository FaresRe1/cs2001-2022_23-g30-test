Open two instances of your IDE with one opening the frontend folder and the other opening the backend folder.

To connect to the database you either need the Brunel VPN or be using the University's WiFi.

If you cannot run the frontend, try using "npm install" to download the node_module dependencies.

If you have trouble committing to GitHub or the commit takes too long, you might be committing the node_modules folder, which is several GB in size.
Github has a file size limit so you will need to append the .gitignore file to include the node_modules folder in frontend.
